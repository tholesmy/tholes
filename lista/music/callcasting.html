                       <p>While "Bad and Boujee" and "T-Shirt" are the standouts on Culture, "Call Casting" became a favorite when the album dropped and it still holds up. Buddha Bless and Bron Bron went all Zaytoven with the keys and in return the Migos delivered a catchy tune. This song will make you feel like Tony Montana when he was shopping for the silver Porsche 928, even though you have a regular job like washing dishes or some shit like that. You can feel like Tony on the used car lot when you cop that 2005 Honda Accord you’ve had your eyes on for the last couple weeks. And once you buy it, you can hook it up, drop it, get some rims, and tell that chick that’s been frontin’ on you to call casting! That’s what “Call Casting” sounds like to me.
