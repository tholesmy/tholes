                       <p>Jason Mraz is a laidback folk-ish singer/songwriter best known for his reggae-grooved hit "I'm Yours." He got his start in the coffee house scene of San Diego, and although he's achieved much commercial success, he still carries socially activist urges, which has always been a part of the folk music scene out of which he emerged. For instance, he recently served as an associate producer and created music for The Big Fix, a documentary that studied the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

                       <p>Mraz's commercial success has already led to two Grammy Awards. One was for "Make It Mine," where he took home Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, while the other was for his duet with Colbie Caillat on "Lucky," which earned him Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. He won both of these in 2010.
