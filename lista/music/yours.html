                       <p>Mraz explained that this song is "about finally giving into love and life's possibilities." When we spoke with the singer in 2014, he said it came to him very quickly - so fast that he doesn't even remember sitting down to write it. "'I'm Yours' just came out of joy," he said. "It came out of this spirited, joyful hour."

                       <p>Since the release of the 2005 demo version of the track, hundreds of fans have posted versions of themselves covering the track on YouTube. Mraz told Billboard magazine: "I never instigated any of the covers. But I can see why people are drawn to the song, and because it is about generosity, I wanted to share it."
