                       <p>This song represents Migos' first proper collaboration with Drake as a trio since the Toronto MC's remix of their breakthrough single "Versace" in 2013. Quavo appeared on Drake's "Portland" and Offset contributed to Metro Boomin's "No Complaints," which also featured the OVO rapper. In addition, Migos remixed Drake's Young Money: Rise of an Empire track "Trophies," but this is technically the first time the Atlanta trio have ever released a new cut as a group with Drizzy.

                       <p>Drake's memorable Jheri curl in the video was a '70s makeover the OVO leader had no hesitation in sporting. "That was all Drake's team," Daps told Billboard. "But me and him did speak on the phone prior to the shoot, and he let me know, 'Hey, look, I'm wearing a Jheri curl, so I hope everyone is wearing afros too.' I was like, yeah, we're going in."
